# weather-dashboard

## Description 

Travelers need to look up the weather forecast for different cities so that they can plan accordingly. This application utilizes the open weather API and looks up the city's current weather, the humidity, wind speed, and UV index.  Furthermore, this application also shows the five-day forecast. 

This project gave me more insight and experience working with APIs and utilizing data from these sources, which helped me improve this application's functionality.

## Usage 

This project gave me more insight and experience working with APIs and utilizing data from these sources, which helped me improve this application's functionality. 

This application's usage is to enable the user to see the current weather of a city and look ahead to the five-day forecast. The color around the UV index dynamically changes. The colors signify the dangers of the rays with green being safe, yellow represents some dangers, orange shows that caution is needed, and red shows very harmful rays.
